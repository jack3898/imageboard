# Imageboard

Inspired by some online image boards (a lot being questionable üòÇ), I thought it would be a fun project to make my own. Make it great on mobile, written in TypeScript.

I plan to use this as more of a personal photo hosting solution for myself but others are welcome to try this out.

## WIP

This project is a bit WIP! Rough edges are inevitable and big breaking changes are too.

Here is a super early sneak peek.
