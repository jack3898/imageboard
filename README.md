# Jackbooru

A booru is an "online imageboard with taggable images". A place to store media, and organise them to make them easy to find.

Inspired by some online imageboards (a lot being questionable ðŸ˜‚), I thought it would be a fun project to make my own. Make it great on mobile, written in TypeScript.

## WIP

This version of the README was written before any code was written. This project has only just started and is a big WIP!

## Install

- Install Volta (https://volta.sh/)
- Run `npm install` on this package

Volta will altomatically read this project and install the exact tested version of Node.js and NPM and use that.

_More install instructions to come._
