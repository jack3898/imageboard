# GraphQL

This folder contains all the GraphQL queries for this client standalone from JS.

To transform the queries into usable code, run `npm run generate` to generate usable code from these queries.

Note:

- Make sure you have the Apollo GraphQL extension installed for syntax highlighting.
- Make sure you suffix your GraphQL files with `-query.graphql`, `-fragment.graphql` or `-mutation.graphql`.
